## Overview
Play a game in your terminal. The game is multiple choice. After you have completed all the questions you will receive a percentage of correct answers.

## How to Play the Game
#### [Repository](git@github.com:KATIETOLER/flashcards.git)

`clone` the repository linked above.

`cd` into the repository.

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Learning Goals and Objectives

* Contribute code to an partially constructed  object-oriented application
* Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

### Site Examples

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:

### [Write Your Own FlashCards](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/flash-cards.html)
 Visit [this site](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/flashcards-starter).

 On the top right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button.

#### Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```
